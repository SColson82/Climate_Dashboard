# Web-Design-Challenge: Web Visualization of Weather Analysis According to Latitude

For this challenge I designed a website for the Weather Analysis Project that was completed in a past challenge. This website consists of the following pages:

1. Main Landing Page
2. Analysis of Max Temp Vs Latitude
3. Analysis of Humidity Vs Latitude
4. Analysis of Cloudiness Vs Latitude
5. Analysis of Wind Speed Vs Latitude
6. Analysis Comparison Page
7. Data Page

Please feel free to click on any picture on the page to be taken to a specific analysis explaination for that data. As for the data page itself, the table headings and the cities columns are locked in place to aid in data understanding as the screen size changes.

The website itself will respond to the size of the screen that it is on so please feel free to view this site on your smart phone as you should find it to be just as user friendly on the small screen as you do on your monitor.
